When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	It's a good idea to create a remote repository when you want to share your code with other users so they can contribute with you.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because if you leave the changes automatically there will be changes published with some features that you haven't finished to develop.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Clone means copy a repository from remote (GitHUB) to local or local to local.
	Forking means cloning a repository from GitHUB to GitHUB.
	Branch means to create a new line of commits when you want to develope a new feature or test something without breaking master code.
