What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository a ".git" folder is created to keep history of the changes in the repository.
	You can use "git status" to check that the repository it's created. 
	You have to make your first commit. Git doesn't do that for you because: 
		1) Maybe you don't want to commit all of your files.
		2) You won't be able to write a message with a description of the commit.
